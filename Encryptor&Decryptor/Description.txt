This code is a JavaScript encryption and decryption program that allows the user to input text, encrypt it with a certain shift, and then decrypt it using the same shift value. The program uses two different functions for both text encryption and numerical encryption to generate the decryption code.

The function "encryptText" encrypts the text inputted by the user using a randomly generated shift value in the range of 1 to 25. Based on the ASCII code of each character in the text, it determines whether it is uppercase or lowercase and then applies the same shift to turn it into encrypted text.

The function "encrypt" encrypts the shift number in such a way that it can be sent to the user and used later for decryption. This function takes a number as an argument, adds a zero to the front if it is a single-digit number, then swaps the digits, converts them into ASCII codes, and concatenates them.

The function "decryptText" decrypts the encrypted text using the same shift value to get back the original text. This function works similarly to the "encryptText" function, but applies the shift in the opposite order.

The function "decrypt" decrypts the number generated by the "encrypt" function to get back the original shift value. This function performs the opposite process to the "encrypt" function.

The HTML file contains two buttons - "Encrypt" and "Decrypt" - that can be used to encrypt and decrypt text according to the user's input. When the user encrypts text, a decryption code is generated and displayed as a notification. To decrypt, the user enters the encrypted text and the decryption code, and then the decrypted text is displayed.
